# Developer Guide

Welcome to the complete developer guide. This document covers everything you need to know.

## Getting Started

This section helps you get up and running quickly.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm 8 or higher
- A code editor of your choice

### Installation

Follow these steps to install the application:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Configure your environment variables
4. Run the development server

## Core Concepts

Understanding the fundamental concepts is essential for effective development.

### Architecture Overview

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns.

#### Frontend Components

The frontend is built with modern web technologies:

- React for user interface
- TypeScript for type safety
- CSS-in-JS for styling

#### Backend Services

The backend provides robust API services:

- RESTful API endpoints
- GraphQL for complex queries
- WebSocket support for real-time features

### Data Flow

Understanding how data flows through the system is crucial.

#### Request Processing

When a request comes in, it follows this path:

1. API Gateway receives the request
2. Authentication middleware validates the user
3. Business logic processes the request
4. Database operations are performed
5. Response is sent back to the client

#### Caching Strategy

We implement multi-level caching:

- Browser cache for static assets
- CDN cache for global content
- Application cache for frequently accessed data

## Advanced Features

These features are available for power users.

### Custom Plugins

Extend the functionality with custom plugins.

#### Plugin Development

Create your own plugins following these guidelines:

1. Implement the plugin interface
2. Register with the plugin manager
3. Test thoroughly
4. Deploy to production

#### Plugin API Reference

The plugin API provides the following hooks:

- `beforeRequest`: Runs before processing requests
- `afterResponse`: Runs after sending responses
- `onError`: Handles error conditions

### Performance Optimization

Learn how to optimize your application for better performance.

#### Database Optimization

Follow these best practices for database performance:

- Use appropriate indexes
- Implement connection pooling
- Optimize query patterns
- Monitor slow queries

#### Frontend Optimization

Improve frontend performance with these techniques:

- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Image optimization
- Bundle size reduction
- Service worker implementation

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions.

### Installation Issues

If you encounter problems during installation:

1. Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
2. Delete node_modules and package-lock.json
3. Run `npm install` again
4. Verify Node.js version compatibility

### Runtime Errors

Common runtime errors and how to fix them:

#### Memory Leaks

Identify and fix memory leaks by:

- Monitoring memory usage
- Using debugging tools
- Fixing event listener issues
- Proper cleanup in lifecycle methods

#### Performance Bottlenecks

Address performance issues by:

- Profiling the application
- Identifying slow operations
- Implementing optimizations
- Monitoring improvements

## Best Practices

Follow these industry best practices for development success.

### Code Quality

Maintain high code quality standards:

- Write clear, readable code
- Add comprehensive tests
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow consistent formatting

### Security

Implement security best practices:
