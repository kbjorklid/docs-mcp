# Technical Specifications

This document outlines the technical specifications and architecture of our platform.

## System Architecture

### Microservices Architecture

Our platform is built on a microservices architecture using containerized services deployed with Kubernetes.

### Service Overview

- API Gateway
- Authentication Service
- User Management Service
- Data Processing Service
- Notification Service
- File Storage Service

## Technology Stack

### Backend Technologies

- Node.js with Express.js
- Python with Django
- Java with Spring Boot
- Go for high-performance services

### Database Technologies

- PostgreSQL for relational data
- MongoDB for document storage
- Redis for caching
- Elasticsearch for search functionality

### Infrastructure

- Docker containers
- Kubernetes orchestration
- AWS cloud infrastructure
- Terraform for infrastructure as code

## API Specifications

### REST API Design

Our REST API follows OpenAPI 3.0 specification with the following design principles:

- Resource-based URLs
- HTTP status codes for responses
- JSON format for data exchange
- JWT authentication
- Rate limiting per client

### GraphQL API

Alternative GraphQL API for complex queries and real-time subscriptions.

## Database Design

### Relational Database Schema

The PostgreSQL database contains the following main tables:

- users
- organizations
- projects
- tasks
- notifications

### NoSQL Document Storage

MongoDB stores flexible document structures for:

- User preferences
- Configuration data
- Audit logs
- Analytics data

## Security Specifications

### Authentication & Authorization

- OAuth 2.0 for third-party integrations
- JWT tokens for API authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-factor authentication support

### Data Protection

- Encryption at rest using AES-256
- Encryption in transit using TLS 1.3
- Data masking for sensitive information
- GDPR compliance features

## Performance Requirements

### Scalability Targets

- 10,000 concurrent users
- 1 million API requests per day
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- <200ms average response time

### Caching Strategy

- Redis for session storage
- CDN for static assets
- Database query caching
- API response caching

## Deployment Architecture

### Container Strategy

All services run in Docker containers with the following specifications:

- Alpine Linux base images
- Multi-stage builds for optimization
- Health checks implemented
- Resource limits configured

### Kubernetes Configuration

- Auto-scaling based on CPU/memory usage
- Rolling updates for zero downtime
- Pod disruption budgets
- Network policies for security

## Monitoring & Observability

### Application Monitoring

- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- Jaeger for distributed tracing
- ELK stack for log aggregation

### Infrastructure Monitoring

- CloudWatch for AWS resources
- Custom health checks
- Performance monitoring
- Cost optimization tracking

## Development Workflow

### CI/CD Pipeline

Our CI/CD pipeline includes:

- Automated testing (unit, integration, e2e)
- Code quality analysis
- Security scanning
- Automated deployment to staging
- Manual approval for production

### Code Quality Standards

- ESLint and Prettier for JavaScript
- Black for Python code formatting
- SonarQube for code quality analysis
- Code coverage requirements (>80%)

## Integration Specifications

### Third-Party Integrations

- Stripe for payment processing
- SendGrid for email services
- Twilio for SMS notifications
- Slack for team communications

### API Integration Guidelines

All third-party integrations follow these guidelines:

- Circuit breaker pattern for resilience
- Exponential backoff for retries
- Request/response logging
- Error handling best practices

## Testing Strategy

### Testing Pyramid

- Unit tests: 70% of all tests
- Integration tests: 20% of all tests
- End-to-end tests: 10% of all tests

### Test Automation

- Jest for unit testing
- Cypress for e2e testing
- Postman for API testing
- Performance testing with k6

## Documentation Standards

### API Documentation

- OpenAPI 3.0 specifications
- Interactive API documentation
- Code examples in multiple languages
- Changelog documentation

### Technical Documentation

- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Runbooks for incident response
- Onboarding guides for developers
- System design documentation
