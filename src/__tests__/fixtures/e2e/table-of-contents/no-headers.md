This document has no markdown headers at all.

It's just a plain text document with some paragraphs.

Here's another paragraph with some **bold text** and *italic text*.

And here's a list:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

There's no structured hierarchy here, just regular content.

This should test how the table_of_contents tool handles documents without any headers.
