# Authentication Guide

This guide covers various authentication methods for securing your API endpoints.

## Overview

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of users or clients attempting to access your API.

## API Key Authentication

API keys are simple tokens that identify and authenticate API clients.

### Generating API Keys

API keys should be randomly generated and sufficiently long to prevent guessing.

### Using API Keys

Include API keys in request headers or query parameters.

## OAuth 2.0

OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that enables secure token-based authentication.

### Authorization Code Flow

The authorization code flow is suitable for web applications with server-side components.

### Client Credentials Flow

Use client credentials flow for machine-to-machine communication.

## JWT Authentication

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) provide a compact and self-contained way to transmit authentication information.

### JWT Structure

A JWT consists of three parts: header, payload, and signature.

### Best Practices

Follow security best practices when implementing JWT authentication.
